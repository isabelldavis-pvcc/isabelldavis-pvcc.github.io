    <td>Software Engineering</td>
    <td>the intent of focus on the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software application; while using engineering principles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Integrated development environment(IDE):</td>
    <td>is an application that can help programmers to write, test, build, and even package certain software code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>*Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)*:</th>
    <td>is a professional orgainization</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Purpose of ACM:</td>
    <td>The purpose of ACM is to advance computer techology and the field of it, by uniting educators, researchers, and professionals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Benefits of ACM membership:</td>
    <td>having a membership with the ACM has a few benefits but really it has to do with networking. Meeting the people who not only will advance you but your career.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Student ACM membership:</td>
    <td>this membership provides access to resources for learning, networking, and sharing the advanced knowledge a student would know have access to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>*Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers(IEEE)*</th>
    <td>is a non profit organization for the top computer scientist to have a community.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Purpose of IEEE:</td>
    <td>is to have a community of technical leaders and to be able to pass information between individuals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Benefits of IEEE membership:</td>
    <td>the main benefits of this membership is the learning experience, the collaboration, and the networking of the many conferences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Student IEEE membership:</td>
    <td>gives you the access to a very big network of different professionals and to have to opportunity to advance yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>*Software Life Cycle:Development Phase*</th>
    <td>this stage is where the actual coding is started</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Requirements analysis:</td>
    <td>this is where the team as the opportunity to come together and find what this software system needs or should have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Design:</td>
    <td>this is the stage where the software developers define the technical details of their product.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Implementation:</td>
    <td>this phase is where the code is translated into a working product</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Testing:</td>
    <td>This is the process where software is tested to ensure that it mets the objective</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Modular Implementation:</td>
    <td>the developers break down the system break down the system into smaller modules for easier development</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Unifed Modeling Language(UML):</td>
    <td>this is a visual language that helps developers create a new system by drawing diagrams and such.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Use Case:</td>
    <td>the way a user interacts with the system and/or product to achieve the goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Use Case diagram:</td>
    <td>this diagram describes the high-level functions and the scope of the system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>*Data Relationships:*</th>
    <td>containers that associate related fields in an application, without storing data themselves</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>one-to-one:</td>
    <td>this is a link between two tables where each record in one table is associated with only one record</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>one-to-many:</td>
    <td>when a single record in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>many-to-many:</td>
    <td>occurs when multiple records in one table are associated with multiple records from another</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Design Pattern:</td>
    <td>is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that helps solve common problems in software development</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Software quality assurance (SQA):</td>
    <td>which is the process that monitors and ensures the quality and reliability of the software products that are being used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>*Software Testing*:</th>
    <td>this is where the product is evaluated to ensure that is meets the expectatons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Glass box testing:</td>
    <td>this method examines the internal structure of an application</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Black box testing:</td>
    <td>this method check the fuctionality without knowing how it's coded or even designed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Beta testing:</td>
    <td>this sends out a test product to a select group of individuals to see how it is works.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Alpha tesitng:</td>
    <td>this is the first end-to-end testing of the product to make sure that is meets all requirments</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>*Documentation*</th>
    <td>this is the information that describes the certain product and how to use it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>User documentation</td>
