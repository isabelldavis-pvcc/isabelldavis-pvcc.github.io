<h1>Chapter 5: Programming Algorithms & Software Testing</h1>
<h2>Phases of computer program development:</h2>
    <li>Phase 1: Understand the problem</li>
    <li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
    <li>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropraite language based on the algorithm</li>
    <li>Phase 4: Enter the program and save</li>
    <li>Phase 5: Execute the program</li>
    <li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>
    <li>Phase 7: Document and evaluate the program</li>
<h1>Programming Structures:</h1>
    <li>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</li>
    <li>Decision structures: if/the/else</li>
    <li>Iterative (Looping):</li>
        <li>while loop: continue looping as long as something is true</li>
        <li>repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true</li>
        <li>for loop: loop a given number of times</li>
    <li>Recursive structures:</li>
        <li>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</li>
        <li>Repetition continues until:</li>
            <li>degeneration case, which is a termination condition, is met</li>
            <li>(degrenerative case is also called a "base case")</li>
<h1>Two classic programming/database problems:</h1>
    <li>Sorting: Descending order/Ascending order</li>
        <li>Sorting numbers</li>
        <li>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</li>
    <li>Searching: find specific data that meet a certain criteria</li>
        <li>In database:</li>
            <li>Filters: temporary search</li>
            <li>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</li>
    <li>Two popular search techniques:</li>
        <li>Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time</li>
        <li>Binary Search:</li>
            <li>only works if data is SORTED first</li>
            <li>start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>
<h1>Two classic program goals:</h1>
    <li>Efficiency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources</li>
    <li>Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</li>

    <td>Kinds of Tests:</td>
    <td>Architectural flaws</td>
    
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Acceptance testing: Verifying whether the whole system works as intended</td>
    <td>Poor design decisions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Integration testing: Ensuring that software components or functions operate together</td>
    <td>Invalid or incorrect functionality</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Unit testing: Validating that each software unit runs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application.</td>
    <td>Security vulnerabilities</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Functional testing: Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. Black-box testing is a common way to verify functions.</td>
    <td>Scalability issues</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Performance testing: Testing how the software runs under different workloads.</td>
    <th>Testing best practices:</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Regression testing: Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality.</td>
    <td>Continous testing: This type of software testing relies on test automation that is integrated witht he deployment process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Stress testing: Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails. Stress testing is considered to be a type of non-fuctional testing.</td>
    <td>Configuration management: Organizations centrally maintain tet assets and track what software builds to test.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Usability testing: Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task.</td>
    <td>Servic virtualization: simulates the services and systems that are missing or not yet completed, enabling teams to reduce dependencies and test sooner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>_______________</td>
    <td>Defect or "bug tracking": Monitoring defects is important to both testing and development teams for measuring and improving quality. Automated tools allow teams to track defects.</td>
</tr>
    <td>_______________</td>
    <td>Metrics and reporting: reporting and analytics enable team members to share status, goals and test results. Teams quickly see the overall health of the project and monitor it.</td>
