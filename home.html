    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        In the United States there are 94 district courts and they are all organized into 12 different circuit courts. These courts are where certain cases are trailed and brought before a judge. There are different types of judges depending on the crime's degree. Some would assume every case is trailed in the district court system, to contrary belief lesser crimes are sent to district court. The higher offenses are sent to circuit court, so any class 4-1 felonies. Though circuit court does see several different kinds of cases, including appeals. That is why each circuit has its own Court of Appeals, they are the last branch of a trail. There is process the case has to go through before it will even be able to see the appeals court. It is very hard to have your case mentioned to a judge again, and especially hard to have it reviewed again. This last branch in many people's eyes is a myth. 
        A Court of Appeals main job is to make sure that every procedure went by the book. That no one made a mistake from the arresting to that review. There is no jury or judge in a way. It is a group of people looking into your case to see if any foul play happened. They look at how the law was used, or interpreted. It all comes down to someone's interpretation of a few words. Someone making an appeal can claim that the law was used incorrectly or unfairly. There are extreme cases where the law was used correctly but someone was mistreated or there was perjury involved. The context of most laws are very broad or very certain, it is up to trained personnel to be able to understand them. These personnels are trained and tested to make sure they understand fully what responsibility they are taking on.
        The person requesting an appeal is petitioning the courts, they are called the petitioner. They have the right to get the courts to look at their unjust cases, but there is also the respondent who can argue with the petition. The respondent normally will bring their evidence on why this case went the way it should have gone. Before any arguing comes about there is what is called a brief submitted to the court. This is where lawyers start their argument and lay it out for the judge. Also, this is where the petition can be turned down before going back to court.

    <h3>When it all started:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Court of Appeals was not always there just like with all the other courts, it was implemented with an act. The act that brought The Court of Appeals to the surface was The Judiciary Act of 1891. This act gave jurisdiction to this court over the appeals in the district and circuit courts. Also, this act limited the types of appeals that can be processed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the last and final court system. Later, The Court of Appeals had jurisdiction in administrative appeals that are done lower in the judicial chain. Which means that crimes that happen in the Judicial branch are looked into. There was also a law that passed that gave the Senior authoritative power over the other courts and their decisions. For example, if the Senior thought a lower judge gave a harsh sentence then they have the power to change the judges decision. They could overturn cases or change one thing; their power is unlimited when it comes to right and wrong.
